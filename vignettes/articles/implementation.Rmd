This document contains some implementation notes for the `mixvlmc`
package.

## Suffix tree

The package uses suffix trees to build efficiently context trees. Suffix
trees are constructed from the integer representation of the discrete
time series, assuming that they contain only non negative integers. As a
consequence, negative values can be used as sentinels. 

Following [Garivier's paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.881742) we build 
the suffix tree of the reverse sequence (in other words the prefix tree).

### Representation

The suffix tree is represented by a main C++ class `SuffixTree` which
uses `EdgeNode` objects internally. As indicated by the name, an
`EdgeNode` represents both a node in the suffix tree and the edge used
to reach it from another node.

An `EdgeNode` contains:

-   a compact representation of the subsequence that labels its edge
    using `start` and `end` as the position of this subsequence in the
    main one. `start` is included in the subsequence `end` is not.
    During the construction of the suffix tree `end` can be set to `n+1`
    where `n` is the length of the main sequence. This is the classical
    trick used to represent open ended edges;
-   a dictionary of its `children` (if any): this maps an element of the
    sequence to (a pointer to) the corresponding child `NodeEdge`;
-   a `suffix` pointer that represents a suffix link;
-   a `parent` pointer that points to the parent node (used during node expansion);
-   a `counts` pointer to a map that maps values to the number of times the subsequence
    represented by the current node (from the root) is preceded by this value
    in the original sequence;
-   an integer `total_count` which gives the number of occurrences of the subsequence when      preceded by another value;
-   an integer `depth` that gives the length of the subsequence represented by this node;
-   a `positions` pointer that points to a vector of positions of the subsequence
   in the orginal sequence.
    
Notice that only the `start`, `end`, `suffix` and `parent` are set during the 
suffix tree construction. 

### Construction

The suffix tree is constructed using [Ukkonen's algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01206331). More precisely, for a sequence
`x`, we build the suffix tree of `rev(x)[-1]`: the tree contains all the prefixes
of `x` without its last value. This guarantees that all subsequences detected by
the tree appeared followed by at least one value, which makes them potential
contexts. Notice that following a link in the suffix tree corresponds to extending
a context into the past which is exactly what is needed for the pratical use of
the suffix tree as a context tree. 

### Counts

After the construction of the suffix tree, the `compute_counts` method is used
to compute the number of occurrences of each subsequence represented by the 
suffix tree as well as the distribution of the values that follow them in the 
original sequence, as proposed in [Garivier's paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.881742). The method uses `rev(x)[1]`,
that is the last value of `x` to include this final value in the counts.
