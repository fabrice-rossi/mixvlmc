#' Individual household electric power consumption
#'
#' A data set containing measurements of the electric power consumption of one
#' household with a time resolution of 10 minutes for the full year of 2008.

#' The original data have been averaged over a 10 minute time period (discarding
#' missing data in each period). The data set contains only
#' the measurements from year 2008.
#'
#' Notice that the different variables are expressed in the adapted units.
#' In particular, the sub-meters are measuring active energy (in watt-hour) while
#' the global active power is expressed in kilowatt.
