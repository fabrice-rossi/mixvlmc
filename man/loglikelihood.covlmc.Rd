\title{Log-Likelihood of a VLMC with covariates}
\usage{
\method{loglikelihood}{covlmc}(vlmc, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{vlmc}{the vlmc representation.}

\item{newdata}{an optional discrete time series.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for loglikelihood.}
}
\value{
the log-likelihood of the VLMC with a nobs attribute that accounts for the number of data included in the likelihood calculation.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the log-likelihood of a VLMC with covariates fitted on a discrete time series.
When the optional arguments \code{newdata} is  provided, the function evaluates instead the
log-likelihood for this (new) discrete time series on the new covariates which must be provided through a newcov parameter.
