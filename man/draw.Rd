\title{Text based representation of a context tree}
\usage{
draw(ct, control = draw_control(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct}{a context tree.}

\item{control}{a list of low level control parameters of the text
representation. See details and \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for draw.}
}
\value{
the context tree (invisibly).
}
\description{
This function 'draws' a context tree as a text.
}
\details{
The function uses basic "ascii art" to represent the context tree. Characters
used to represent the structure of the tree, e.g. branches, can be modified
using \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}}.

In addition to the structure of the context tree, \code{draw} can represent
information attached to the node (contexts and partial contexts). This is
controlled by additional parameters depending on the type of the context
tree (as well as by the \code{control} parameter).

\examples{
dts <- sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)
ctree <- ctx_tree(dts, min_size = 10, max_depth = 2)
draw(ctree)
dts_c <- sample(c("A", "B", "CD"), 100, replace = TRUE)
ctree_c <- ctx_tree(dts_c, min_size = 10, max_depth = 2)
draw(ctree_c, draw_control(root = "x"))
