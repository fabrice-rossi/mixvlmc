\usage{
\method{contexts}{vlmc}(
  ct,
  type = c("auto", "list", "data.frame"),
  reverse = TRUE,
  frequency = NULL,
  positions = FALSE,
  counts = c("desc", "local"),
  cutoff = NULL,
  metrics = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct}{a context tree.}

\item{type}{result type (see details).}

\item{reverse}{logical (defaults to TRUE). See details.}

\item{frequency}{specifies the counts to be included in the result
data.frame. The default value of \code{NULL} does not include anything.
\code{"total"} gives the number of occurrences of each context in the original
sequence. \code{"detailed"} includes in addition the break down of these
occurrences into all the possible states.}

\item{positions}{logical (defaults to FALSE). Specify whether the positions
of each context in the time series used to build the context tree should
be reported in a \code{positions} column of the result data frame. The
availability of the positions depends on the way the context
tree was built. See details for the definition of a position.}

\item{counts}{specifies how the counts reported by \code{frequency} are computed.
The default value \code{"desc"} includes both counts that are specific to the
context (if any) and counts from the descendants of the context in the
tree. When \code{counts = "local"} the counts include only the number of times
the context appears without being the last part of a longer context.}

\item{cutoff}{specifies whether to include the cut off value associated to
each context (see \code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} and \code{\link[=prune]{prune()}}). The default result with
\code{cutoff=NULL} does not include those values. Setting \code{cutoff} to \code{quantile}
adds the cut off values in quantile scale, while \code{cutoff="native"} adds
them in the native scale. The returned values are directly based on the
log likelihood ratio computed in the context tree and are not modified to
ensure pruning (as when \code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} is called by  \code{raw=TRUE}).}

\item{metrics}{if TRUE, adds predictive metrics for each context (see \code{\link[=metrics]{metrics()}}
for the definition of predictive metrics).}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the contexts function.}
}
\value{
The list of class \code{contexts} containing the contexts represented in
this tree (as \code{ctx_node}) or a data.frame.
}
\description{
This function extracts all the contexts from a fitted VLMC, possibly with
some associated data.
}
\details{
The default result for \code{type="auto"} (or \code{type="list"}),
\code{frequency=NULL}, \code{cutoff=NULL} and \code{metrics=FALSE} is the list of all contexts.

Other results are obtained only with \code{type="auto"} or \code{type="data.frame"}.
See \code{\link[=contexts.ctx_tree]{contexts.ctx_tree()}} for details about the \code{frequency} parameter. When
\code{cutoff} is non \code{NULL}, the resulting \code{data.frame} contains a \code{cutoff}
column with the cut off values, either in quantile or in native scale. See
\code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} and \code{\link[=prune]{prune()}} for the definitions of cut off values and of the
two scales.
}
\section{Cut off values}{
 The cut off values reported by \code{contexts.vlmc} can
be different from the ones reported by \code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} for three reasons:
\enumerate{
\item \code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} reports only useful cut off values, i.e., cut off values that
should induce a simplification of the VLMC when used in \code{\link[=prune]{prune()}}. This
exclude cut off values associated to simple contexts that are smaller than
the ones of their descendants in the context tree. Those values are
reported by \code{context.vlmc}.
\item \code{context.vlmc} reports only cut off values of actual contexts, while
\code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}} reports cut off values for all nodes of the context tree.
\item values are not modified to induce pruning, contrarily to the default
behaviour of \code{\link[=cutoff]{cutoff()}}
}
}

\section{Positions}{
 A position of a context \code{ctx} in the time series \code{x} is an
index value \code{t} such that the context ends with \code{x[t]}. Thus \code{x[t+1]} is after
the context. For instance if \code{x=c(0, 0, 1, 1)} and \code{ctx=c(0, 1)} (in standard
state order), then the position of \code{ctx} in \code{x} is 3.
}

\section{State order in a context}{
 Notice that contexts are given by default
in the "reverse" order used by the VLMC papers: older values are on the
right. For instance, the context \code{c(0, 1)} is reported if the sequence 1,
then 0 appeared in the time series used to build the context tree. Set
reverse to \code{FALSE} for the reverse convention.
