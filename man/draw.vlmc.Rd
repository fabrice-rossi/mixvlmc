\title{Text based representation of a vlmc}
\usage{
\method{draw}{vlmc}(ct, control = draw_control(), prob = TRUE, ...)

\method{draw}{vlmc_cpp}(ct, control = draw_control(), prob = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct}{a fitted vlmc.}

\item{control}{a list of low level control parameters of the text
representation. See details and \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}}.}

\item{prob}{this parameter controls the display of node level information in
the tree. The default \code{prob=TRUE} represents the conditional distribution
of the states given the (partial) context associated to the node. Setting
\code{prob=FALSE} replaces the conditional distribution by the frequency of the
states that follow the context as in \code{\link[=draw.ctx_tree]{draw.ctx_tree()}}. Setting \code{prob=NULL}
removes all additional information.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for draw.}
}
\value{
the context tree (invisibly).
}
\description{
This function 'draws' a context tree as a text.
}
\details{
The function uses basic "ascii art" to represent the context tree. Characters
used to represent the structure of the tree, e.g. branches, can be modified
using \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}}.

In addition to the structure of the context tree, \code{draw} can represent
information attached to the node (contexts and partial contexts). This is
controlled by additional parameters depending on the type of the context
tree.
