\usage{
\method{draw}{vlmc}(ct, format, control = draw_control(), prob = TRUE, ...)

\method{draw}{vlmc_cpp}(ct, format, control = draw_control(), prob = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct}{a fitted vlmc.}

\item{format}{a character string that specifies the output format of the
function. Possible values are \code{ascii} (default) and \code{latex}. See details.}

\item{control}{a list of low level control parameters of the text
representation. See details and \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}}.}

\item{prob}{this parameter controls the display of node level information in
the tree. The default \code{prob=TRUE} represents the conditional distribution
of the states given the (partial) context associated to the node. Setting
\code{prob=FALSE} replaces the conditional distribution by the frequency of the
states that follow the context as in \code{\link[=draw.ctx_tree]{draw.ctx_tree()}}. Setting \code{prob=NULL}
removes all additional information.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for draw.}
}
\value{
the context tree (invisibly).
}
\description{
This function 'draws' a context tree as a text.
}
\details{
The function uses different text based formats (plain "ascii art" and LaTeX)
to represent the context tree. Fine tuning of the representation can be done
via the \code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}} function.

In addition to the structure of the context tree, \code{draw()} can represent
information attached to the nodes (contexts and partial contexts). This is
controlled by additional parameters depending on the type of the context
tree. In general, parameters given directly to \code{draw()} specify \emph{what}
information is represented while details on \emph{how} this representation is made
can be controlled via the \code{control} parameter and the associated
\code{\link[=draw_control]{draw_control()}} function.
}
\section{Format}{


The \code{format} parameter specifies the format used for the textual output.
With the default value \code{ascii} the output is produced in "ascii art" using
by default only ascii characters (notice that \code{draw_control()} can be used
to specified non ascii characters, but this is discouraged).

With the \code{latex} value, the output is produced in LaTeX, leveraging the
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/forest}{forest} Latex package (see
\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/forest}). Each call to \code{draw()} produces a full
\code{forest} LaTeX environment. This can be included as is in a LaTeX document,
provided the \code{forest} package is loaded in the preamble of the document.
The LaTeX output is sanitized to avoid potential problems induced by
special characters in the names of the states of the context tree.
